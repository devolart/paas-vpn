3. Go to the **Access Controls** tab and save the following JSON into **Edit file** section, replacing <code>email</code>
with the email shown in **Users** tab (if you use GitHub login, then it will be different. Please keep that in mind).
    ```json
    {
        "acls": [
          { "action": "accept", "src": ["*"], "dst": ["*:*"] },
        ],
        "tagOwners": {
          "tag:vpn": ["email"],
        },

### Deployment:
1. Point your PaaS deployment to this GitHub repo (or fork it if needed) or this public docker image `paasvpn/paasvpn`.
2. Set these environment variables.

`TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`: Your auth key

`HOSTNAME`: Unique identifier for the VPN instance, do not use any spaces (you can fill some random string here)

`PORT` (Optional): Port for the front-end web interface. If you're not sure, try not using this first. If it doesn't work, try using 8080 port.
### Post Deployment guide:
1. Open tailscale client on the device you want to use VPN. (Guide shows for android)
